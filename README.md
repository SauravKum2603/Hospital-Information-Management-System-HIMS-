# Hospital-Information-Management-System-HIMS-
A complete MySQL-based Hospital Information Management System designed to manage hospital operations including patient registration, doctor scheduling, appointments, billing, payments, medical records, prescriptions, and pharmacy inventory.

The Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) is a MySQL-based database project designed to digitize and centralize various operational processes of a hospital. It handles patient registration, doctor scheduling, appointment booking, medical records, billing, payments, and pharmacy inventory, providing an efficient and scalable solution for hospital administration.

Objectives
1.To eliminate manual record-keeping by automating hospital workflows.
2.To provide accurate, secure, and easily retrievable patient and doctor information.
3.To streamline appointment booking and billing processes.
4.To track medicine inventory and prescriptions.
5.To support multi-role access (admin, doctor, pharmacist, receptionist) for secure operations.
